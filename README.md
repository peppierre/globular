# globular

Feature-based Javascript framework

## A short story

Imagine that you have just finished your web application. A brand new stuff based on a popular framework which proves maintainability since there are many developers out there in the jungle who could maintain it.

But time is changing and a new framework is raised. A better one, a modern one and decision is quite obvious: you must port you application. And this is the point when you face the fact that framework you used dominates your application, no chance to simply change the view itself and leaving business logic untouched. You must rewrite the whole application from scratch, only a small set of code could be re-used.

## Globular comes into picture

If your application's core logic could be re-usable, you may save tons of work. And this is what Globular provides you.
